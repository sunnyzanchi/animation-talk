# Make Your Animations Less Janky with Zanchi

# Agenda

1. What is Jank?
2. Why?
3. The Render Pipeline
4. Practical Application
5. Tooling
6. Maybe? Animation Design

# What is Jank?

--

Animations or transitions that stutter or lag.
This comes mostly from inconsistent framerate (or really low framerates).

## User Experience!

# The Render Pipeline

.center.middle[![Render Pipeline](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/images/intro/frame-full.jpg)]

This is how your styles go from CSS to being pixels on the screen.
The browser has to go through this process for every element on the screen.

---

# Style Changes

.center.middle[![Render Pipeline](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/images/intro/frame-full.jpg)]

When you make a style change, the browser has to apply those changes.

```css

nav.site-nav ul li {
  color: gray;
}

nav.site-nav ul li.active {
  color: blue;
}

nav.site-nav ul li.active:last-of-type {
  color: lightblue;
}
```

---

# Layout Changes

.center.middle[![Render Pipeline](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/images/intro/frame-full.jpg)]

Changing any properties that affect the geometry of an element cause a reflow/layout change.
This then causes a repaint, which the compositor then has to put together.
This is the _most_ expensive type of style change.
These properties include:
+ `bottom ` / `left` / `right` / `top`
+ `height`
+ `margin`
+ `padding`
+ `width`

---

# Paint Changes

.center.middle[![Render Pipeline](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/images/intro/frame-no-layout.jpg)]

Changing any properties that affect the color of an element (besides opacity), will cause a repaint.
This means the browser doesn't have to calculate the positions of any elements, but it will have to recalculate the color of each pixel within the repaint area.
This is less expensive than reflows, but can still cause performance issues when trying to repaint large areas.
These properties include:

+ `background`
+ `color`
+ `box-shadow`

---

# Compositor Only Changes

.center.middle[![Render Pipeline](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/images/intro/frame-no-layout-paint.jpg)]

There are two properties you can change that do not cause a reflow or repaint.
These two are `opacity` and `transform`.
These two properties can be changes solely in the compositor, which are relatively cheap operations.
These are the best properties to use to ensure smooth animations/transitions.

---

# Practical Application

--

## Only Transition `transform`

Simple Example https://codepen.io/anon/pen/xQwGWO

## Only Transition `opacity`

Simple Example https://codepen.io/anon/pen/eQpNxp

---

# Practical Application

+ Avoid long-blocking JavaScript (move expensive calculations to WebWorkers)

--

+ Use less complicated selectors

--

+ [Use flexbox!!!](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/avoid-large-complex-layouts-and-layout-thrashing)

--

+ Do as little layout as possible

--

+ Read any style properties you need _before_ you start making updates

--

+ Reduce paint areas

--

+ Promote layers as necessary

---
